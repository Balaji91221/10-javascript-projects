# Joke API Project

This project uses the [JokeAPI](https://jokeapi.dev/) to fetch random jokes, and displays them on a webpage. It demonstrates the use of the `async/await` function in JavaScript.

## Usage

To use this project, you will need to obtain an API key from the [JokeAPI website](https://jokeapi.dev/). Once you have an API key, you can replace the placeholder text in the `index.js` file with your own key.
